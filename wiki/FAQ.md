## How do I create Parker wind profiles?

Refer to construct_parkers.py and that you usually want to then simulate those with converged_parkers_1D.py.

## How do I choose the composition of the atmosphere?

Refer to command-line arguments of both .py codes.

## How do I calculate the transmission spectrum?

Refer to RT.py

## How do I simulate one planet with different stellar SEDs?

Refer to -SEDname flag in converged_parkers_1D.py

## I get the error "<find out what the error is when making spectra of species that has not been saved>"

Explain -save_sp flag in converged_parkers_1D.py

## Why do I have to specify a `-pdir` and a `-dir`?

Explain.
