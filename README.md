Python package to simulate the upper atmospheres of exoplanets and their observational signatures.

The main use of the code is to construct 1D Parker wind profiles (Parker 1958) using the Python p-winds package (dos Santos et al. 2022), to simulate these with photoionization code Cloudy (Ferland et al. 1998; 2017), and to post-process the output with a custom radiative transfer module to predict the transmission spectra of exoplanets.
